![](https://blog.ikomia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/fasterrcnn.jpg)

Ikomia plugin to launch inference on Faster RCNN object detection model. Inference can be made from pre-trained model on COCO dataset or from custom trained model. Indeed you can use the [Ikomia FasterRCNNTrain plugin](https://github.com/Ikomia-dev/FasterRCNNTrain) to make the training. This plugin is based on [PyTorch torchvision implementation](https://github.com/pytorch/vision).

### How to use it?
Here are the steps:

1. Create Ikomia account for free [here](https://ikomia.com/accounts/signup/) (if you don't have one)
2. Install [Ikomia software](https://ikomia.com/en/download)
3. Launch the software and log in with your credentials
4. Open Ikomia Store and install FasterRCNN plugin
5. Open your images
6. Add FasterRCNN algorithm to the workflow
7. Start the workflow and evaluate the prediction

That's it!
